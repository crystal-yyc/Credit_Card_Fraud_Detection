# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
* Data can be downloaded from the kgggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
* Detecting Credit Card Fraud Transactions using Different Machine Learning Algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Voting Classifier of combining Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes algorithms, and XGBoost by iterating feature selections based on threshold;
* Using Neural Network to predict fraud transactions;
* Due to the extreme data class imbalances, the over-sampling methods of the imblearn library have been used to generating more training data;
* In summary: XGBoost with the selected features of 15 can generate balanced recall score, accuracy score and f1 score.
